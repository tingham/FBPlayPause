FBPlayPause
===========

Snippet code for the excellent FogBugz software which adds a play / pause button to the case UI for logging time.

Installation
============

Browse to your snippets section in the FogBugz interface. Create a new snippet for yourself (or your team) and paste the contents of the main javascript file into the resulting field.
Reloading a case page should show you the play/pause button in the ixBug region of the page (the big case number.)
