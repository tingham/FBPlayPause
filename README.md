FBPlayPause
===========

Customization code for the excellent FogBugz software which adds a play / pause button to the case UI for logging time.

Installation
============

Browse to your customizations section in the FogBugz interface. Create a new customization for yourself (or your team) and paste the contents of the main javascript file into the resulting field.
Once you've added the customization, you'll have to remember to activate it in the list of "Available Customizations" or "Your Customizations" respectively.
Reloading a case page should show you the play/pause button in the ixBug region of the page (the big case number.)
